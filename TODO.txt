-----------High priority------------

Complete spec document
Schematics

	1. double check schematic.
	2. Make matching footprints for symbols above: FETs, foglights, resistors, caps, pushbutton, arduino mini, adruino nano, external clock, serial header, LED header, 16x2 LCD 

	
Layout
	-round off edges of the board
	-No need for fiducials
	-Need mounting holes
	
Gerbers and order boards
------------Low priority--------------
Reorganize all folders in a more readable format
clean up and modulize the different functions in wakelight.ino
Add a rotary encoder switch to trigger "snooze" or "alarm off"
Use button on rotary encoder to trigger a "menu" for setting up time/alarm without computer input
implement a python wrapper for menu
bluetooth with phone
source brighter LED's

------------------COMPLETED--------------
Make custom symbols for: FETS, foglights, pushbutton (completed Jan 20, 2016)
Make arduino symbols look nicer (i.e. group GPIO pins, power pins, gnd, etc) (completed Jan 20, 2016)
add external I2C oscillator function (October 15, 2015)
Add pullup resistor to left and right knobs for rotary encoder and connect to ADC. This clears up the other 2 GPIOs for full control of tri-color LED strips. Have the btn remain as a GPIO interrupt (Oct 23, 2016)
