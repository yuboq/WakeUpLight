Currently, this device turns on LED strip at 5AM, and gradually increases in brightness in a half hour period. Currently, I have not implemented a external oscillator yet, so the time will need to be reset every night at 11pm, because once the alarm turns on, it will not shut off until you turn off power. 

Eventually, the goal for this project is to create a beautiful standalone alarm clock that can help others wake up more naturally, similar to the Philips Wake Up Light, but with more customizations
